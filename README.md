## Website Portfolio

### Description
This project is my second attempt at creating a website portfolio. Unlike my first attempt, which used Express to serve static files using the EJS template engine, this website is created using ReactJS. Styling is done using Tailwind, which has allowed for much easier responsive design and mobile integration.

### To Run
Open a terminal in the root directory and run the command
```bash
npm install
```
Once all the dependencies are installed, run the command
```bash
npm start
```
React will automatically open a browser window and start the webpage on localhost:3000
